# Repository checklist
After copying the contents of this repo into the new repo-to-be, follow the below steps:

1. Update README.md.
   1. Replace the logo and the alt text of the logo image element.
   1. Change the first heading and the description of the repository.
   1. Keep the rest of the README.md intact (license notice, links to contribution guidelines et cetera).
1. Create a repo-name-maintainers team in the eiffel-community organization.
   1. Make all members of the team maintainers (so they can add new maintainers as needed).
   1. Give the team write access to the new repository.
1. Update CONTRIBUTING.md
   1. Replace repository URLs.
   1. Replace links to maintainers' team.
1. Create a maintainers' mailing list. There are no requirements on mailing list providers, but it needs to be invite only, readable by members only, but accept mails from non-members. [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/) can easily set up such mailing lists.
1. Replace the placeholder maintainers' mailing list address in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
